To use the neural network (without training):
use image_resize.py to normalize and scale all images to 1000x1000
    place all images into fullTrain/to_resizee
    results will be placed into fullTrain/1k

make sure newTrain.mat is in directory

open matlab and make the CD 2D-Material-Search/NeuralNet (will not work if this is not the case)

run step4

To train the neural network, use image_resize.py, but do not normalize the images, only rescale.

Go through step1 to step3

step1 will take a long time as you have to manually scan through and identify flakes
step2 and 3 will not require any user input other than running them

then repeat lines 1-10 to run your new model
